                <p>
                    I am a full stack developer originally from Rochester, New York. I graduated from
                    Rochester Institute of Technology in 2018 with a bachelor's degree
                    in chemistry and a focus on inorganic chemistry and mathematics.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    My interest in web development and programming in general comes from my experience while
                    doing research at RIT. I was tasked with imrpoving the programs that were used to run
                    our instrumentation, as well as developing new programs. Since this was my first foray into 
                    programming, I had to learn on the fly by looking into other programming languages like
                    javascript.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Since then, I have become fully devoted to becoming a full time web developer. I am currently
                    enrolled in the Georgia Tech web development bootcamp, and I am scheduled to graduate in late May 2019.
